Importent question:

WHat are the various ways of importing modules/libraries in python?
1.Import module_name
2.from module_name import something
3.from module_name import *  (star means everything)
4.import module_name as alias or nickname

OOPs:
Object oriented programming. It create to solve real world programs by taking real world entities.
Advantages:
1.Code re-usability
2.code eficiency
3.Security
4.Scalable code structure

Pillers:

1.Inheritance: The property by virtue of which a child class can inherit the properties of a parent class , is called Inheritance.

Humans follow multiple Inheritance.

a.Singel level
b.Multi-leel
c.Multiple
d.Hybrid
e.Hierarchical

2.Encapsulation
3.Abstraction
4.Polymorphism: The propety by virtue of which same method can behave differently in different scenarios is called Polymorphism.

Poly-Many 
Morphism-Forms/Shapes

Two types:
i)Overloading
ii)Over-riding

In python we are having two more importent concepts:
1.Operator overloading
2.Duck Typing: As long as it behaves like a duck,quacks like a duck, walks like a duck,it is a duck.
->As long as a function is getting supply of resources,it will work and not bother about the sources.

Association:
Aggregation->Has-A Relationship (Loosely coupled classes)
ex:-Car & Music player
Composition->Is-A Relationship  (Tightly coupled classes)
ex:- Car & Engine
